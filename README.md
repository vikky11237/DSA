# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python.

## Contents

1. Sorting Algorithms
   - Bubble Sort (`bubble_sort.py`): A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Time Complexities

| Algorithm    | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Bubble Sort | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)            |

## How to Run

Each algorithm is contained in its own Python file. To run any algorithm, simply use Python:

```bash
python <filename>.py
```
